        <h2>Welcome to Our Weight Loss Diet Plan</h2>
        <p>Losing weight requires a combination of a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Our weight loss diet plan is designed to help you achieve your weight loss goals in a sustainable and healthy way.</p>
        <h3>Key Components of the Diet Plan:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calorie Deficit:</strong> To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. Focus on eating nutrient-dense foods that keep you feeling full while reducing your overall calorie intake.</li>
            <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls, and be mindful of serving sizes to prevent unnecessary calorie consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Fiber Foods:</strong> Fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help you feel full and satisfied while consuming fewer calories. Aim to include plenty of fiber in your meals and snacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Lean Protein:</strong> Protein is essential for preserving muscle mass and supporting weight loss. Include lean sources of protein such as chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, and legumes in your meals.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Incorporate sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil into your diet. These fats help keep you satiated and support overall health.</li>
        </ul>

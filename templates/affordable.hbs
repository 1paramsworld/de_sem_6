        <h2>Welcome to Our Affordable Diet Plan</h2>
        <p>Eating healthy doesn't have to break the bank. Our affordable diet plan is designed to provide you with nutritious meals that won't strain your wallet.</p>
        <h3>Key Principles of the Diet Plan:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus on Whole Foods:</strong> Whole foods such as grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables are often more affordable than processed foods. Base your meals around these nutritious and budget-friendly options.</li>
            <li><strong>Buy in Bulk:</strong> Purchasing staple items like rice, beans, and oats in bulk can help you save money in the long run. Look for discounts and sales at your local grocery store or consider shopping at bulk stores.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Your Meals:</strong> Planning your meals ahead of time can help you avoid impulse purchases and make the most of your ingredients. Create a weekly meal plan and make a shopping list to ensure you only buy what you need.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook at Home:</strong> Eating out can quickly add up, both in terms of cost and calories. Cooking at home allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes of your meals while saving money.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Processed Foods:</strong> Processed foods like packaged snacks and sugary drinks can be expensive and offer little nutritional value. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods to get the most bang for your buck.</li>
        </ul>
